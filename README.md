# VR-NanoDegree-Projects
This repo contains all projects developed on Term 1 and 2 made in Udacity's VR Developer NanoDegree course. 
All projects were developed using Unity 3D.

Each project is in a separate branch.
My naive goal was to have branches as independent folders, so it would reduce the downloading period when cloning the repo.

To see a project just open a branch.
If you plan to open all these projects locally, I recommend creating folders for each branch.
They are all completely disconnected from one another.

Due to the complexity of Term 3 VR High Immersion Projects, I have created separate repos, and placed their links below.
